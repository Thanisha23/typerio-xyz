Contributions to Typerio are very welcome and thanks in advance for your efforts. I would be glad to git merge your branch.

## Where to start

First of all decide, where do you want to contribute familiarize yourself with existing codebase. 
At this moment you can contribute to all of the 3 projects right there:

- [typerio-reactðŸ”—](https://github.com/Truezeber/typerio-react)
- [typerio-xyzðŸ”—](https://github.com/Truezeber/typerio-xyz)

## Okay, what's next

Typerio isn't a big project, so there are no strict rules what exactly shoud you do. 
You can start by opening an issue, or by cloning the repository and opening pull request. Up to you. 
But - to make things clear - even when there are no exact rules about what can you change, your pull 
request can get rejected because of subjective reasons.
