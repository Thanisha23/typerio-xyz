import MdxLayout from '@/components/mdx-layout'
 
# Typerio-react

First of all you have to install the package from npm. You can do it using commad bellow.

```console
$ npm i typerio-react
```
The next step will be importing Typerio component in the designated place.

```ts
import { Typerio } from 'typerio-react';
```

Typerio takes an array of two objects as argument. The first element is the input you want to animate. Take a look on an example of it below.

```ts
const inputArray = [
  {
    text: 'Text to type',
    style: 'class-of-the-element',
    element: 'p'
  },
]
```
You can place as many objects as you want inside of this array. They can have different HTML element, and you can use provided css class for styling it.
The second element of argument array is so called configuration object, iside of which you have to provide animation frames and speed.

```ts
const configurationObject = {
  frames: ['-', '|'],
  speed: 100
}
```

After that you can simply call the component with prepared arguments.

```ts
return (
  <>
    <Typerio input={[inputArray, configurationObject]} />
  </>
);
```

export default function MDXPage({ children }) {
  return <MdxLayout>{children}</MdxLayout>
}
