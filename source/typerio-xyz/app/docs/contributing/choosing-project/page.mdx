# Choosing a project

When selecting a project included in Typerio, be guided by keeping in mind that:
* Typerio is written in pure JavaScript, without high-level abstraction and without using external NPM packages;
* typerio-react is written in TypeScript, uses external NPM packages, and makes heavy use of hooks and asynchronicity;
* typerio.xyz is written in NextJS, uses TypeScript and MDX.

Familiarity with the project is key to effectively contributing new content.
