# Advanced usage

First, let's explain what the *configuration object* mentioned in the earlier article is. It is an object with the following properties:

```js
{
    frames:['', ''],       //Array of two strings which are the frames of the animation;
    prefix: '',        //String which will be the prefix of the animation;
    speed: 20,     //Integer beign used as the interval between animation frames. Higher number = slower animation;
    target: HTMLElement,       //HTML element inside of which animation will be rendered;
    clearingPolicy: true,      //Boolean value, if true all content inside of the target will be deleted;
},
```

It can be used in several different ways. One is to pass it straight to *typerioRender()* every time, as we did before. Another example:

```js
typerioRender(inputArray, {
    frames: ['|', '_'],
    prefix: '$',
    speed: 60,
    target: targetWindow,
    clearingPolicy: false
});
```

We can also configure *default configuration object*. Data from this object is used by Typerio if we do not pass some value in *typerioRender()*. Take a look at this code:

```js
typerioConfig.setDefaultConfig({
  newFrames: ['o', 'O'],
  newPrefix: '@',
  newSpeed: 12,
  newTarget: element,
  newClearingPolicy: true,
});
```

The syntax differs from that passed manually, but the value types are the same.
We can also get the current *default configuration object* using

```js
typerioConfig.getDefaultConfig();
```

> [!CAUTION]
> The default target value is set to `{}`, which means that you have to declare this value in `typerioConfig` or pass it everytime via `typerioRender()` function.

*typerioRender()* is an asynchronous function. What follows is that we can use *await* to wait for the animation to finish.

```js
await typerioRender(inputArray);
```
