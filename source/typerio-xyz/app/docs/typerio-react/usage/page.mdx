# Usage

Firstly import *Typerio* into your project.

```ts
import { Typerio } from 'typerio-react';
```

``Typerio`` takes an array of two objects as argument. The first element is the input you want to animate. Take a look on an example of it below.

```ts
const inputArray = [
  {
    text: 'Text to type',
    style: 'class-of-the-element',
    element: 'p'
  },
]
```
You can place as many objects as you want inside of this array. They can have different HTML element, and you can use provided css class for styling it.
The second element of argument array is so called configuration object, iside of which you have to provide animation frames and speed.

```ts
const configurationObject = {
  frames: ['-', '|'],
  speed: 100
}
```

After that you can simply call the component with prepared arguments.

```tsx
return (
  <>
    <Typerio input={ [inputArray, configurationObject] } />
  </>
);

```

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> ``Typerio`` is a client-side component. Keep in mind the negative impact of its content on your site's SEO.
