# Typerio

Firstly you have to install Typerio. Simply use this command.

```console
$ npm i typerio
```
## Js

In the next step you need to import ``typerioRender()`` function to your project.

```js
import { typerioRender } from 'typerio'
```
Now you can use it to render a text.

```js
typerioRender(
  input,
  {
    frames,
    prefix,
    speed,
    target,
    clearingPolicy,
  },
  callback
);
```

Let's take a look at the argunets of the function.
- ``input`` is an array of objects with the following properties:

```js
{
    text: string, //Text which will be rendered.
    style: string, //Custom CSS class.
    HTMLelement: HTMLElement //HTML element inside of which text will be
}                            //rendered. Usually p or span
```
- Configuration object:
  - `frames` - Array of 2 string which will be used as an animation.
  - `prefix` - String placed at the beggining of the rendered text.
  - `speed` - Typing animation speed in ms.
  - `target` - HTML element inside of which animation will be rendered.
  - `clearingPolicy` - Boolean value, if true all content inside of the target will be deleted.
- `callback` - Optional function that will be launched after the animation.
> [!NOTE]  
> Every arguments besides input and callback need to be parsed as one object.

>[!TIP]
>``typerioRender()`` is an asynchronic function. If you want to call it on the same target more than once in a row, you can use await to wait untill previous animation is completed.

## CSS

Typerio uses ``typerio`` as default class for every element, ``typerioPrefix`` as class for its prefix and classes provided as ``style`` via input array. To style it, simply declare them inside of your CSS.

#### Customize default configurationðŸª„

Providing the same data as an configuration object in `typerioRender()` function would be a nuisance. That's why version `2.0.0` introduced configuration object which allows you to set the default values which will be used, if you won't provide them via `typerioRender()` function. To change them you can simply use

```javascript
typerioConfig.setDefaultConfig({
  newFrames,
  newPrefix,
  newSpeed,
  newTarget,
  newClearingPolicy,
});
```

As you can see, there are the same arguments as in configuration object. You can also get the default config object using:

```javascript
typerioConfig.getDefaultConfig();
```
> [!WARNING]  
> The default target value is set to `{}`, which means that you have to declare this value in `typerioConfig` or pass it everytime via `typerioRender()` function.
